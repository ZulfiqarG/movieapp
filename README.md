<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is a simple movie website app that utilizes the OMDB API to display information about movies. The goal of the project was to practice using APIs and creating a dynamic website.

The app was initially built using vanilla JavaScript, and a separate branch was created to convert it to jQuery. The app allows users to search for movies by title and view details about the movie.
